# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project 2: React
#### Overview

Let's kick it up a notch and build a modular and modern front end application using React!

Like with project one, our Unit 2 project is a chance to be creative and build something you can be proud of.

You will be working individually for this project, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go.

As part of this project, you'll be required to show your project to your instructors and classmates in a five minute presentation in front of the class. Your goal for this presentation is to extract the most important aspects of what went into building your project into easy-to-use language and practice speaking about your code.

Show us what you've got!
